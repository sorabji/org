  - how to read data from mysql using php
    1. connect to server
       - $connection=mysql_connect(localhost,username,pwd)
    2. select db
       - mysql_select_db(db_name,connection)
    3. sql command
       - $result=mysql_query(query,connection)
    4. if read:
       - mysql_fetch_array($result) : fetches one row at a time as associative array (also access by index)
       - mysql_fetch_assoc($result) : fetches one row at a time as associative array
    5. pass data through anchor:
       - <a href="blah.php?variable=$value&variable=$value"> (use submitform parameter?)
    6. access every row:
       - while (mysql_fetch_array($result)){}
    7. access every element of every row:
#+begin_src php
  while (mysql_fetch_array($result)){
    foreach ($associative_array as $key => $value){
      echo "$key = $value";
    }
  }
#+end_src
