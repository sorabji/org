* today's notes
** transactions
  - Transaction :: big task
  - rollback :: scrap all tasks related to a transaction
  - commit :: save changes (when transaction is successful)

only INNODB supports transaction and locking
by default, autocommit is ON
*** example
set autocommit = 0; // turn off autocommit
...mysql statements... // do your stuff
commit; // commit your changes to the db
or...
rollback; // throw away changes

** locking
types of locks:
   - read lock :: others can read but not write
   - write lock :: others cannot read or write

levels of lock:
   1. table level
   2. row level

*** example
set autocommit = 0; // turn off autocommit
begin transaction; // start a transaction
lock tables tablename write (or read); // lock table 
...statements...
commit; // commit changes
unlock tables; // unlock tables

row level write lock:
  select * from tablename where column=value for update;

row level read lock:
  select * from tablename where column=value lock in share mode;
