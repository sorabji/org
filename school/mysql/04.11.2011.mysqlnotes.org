* subqueries/nested query
  -any 
     SELECT * FROM ab_title WHERE PubId <= ANY (SELECT PubId FROM ab_publisher)
     any is the same as IN
  -all
     SELECT * FROM ab_title WHERE PubId = ALL (SELECT PubId FROM ab_publisher)
     all is the same as NOT IN
  -exists
     SELECT * FROM ab_wrote WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM ab_author WHERE AuthorId = 3)
     as long as inner query returns a result, outer query will run
** correlated subquery
   find all authors that have written books
   + SELECT AuthorId FROM ab_wrote WHERE EXISTS
   + (SELECT * FROM ab_wrote WHERE ab_author.AuthorId = ab_wrote.AuthorId);
      
   
** 
   original:

   1)select MIN(SellingPrice) from ab_title;
   2)select * from ab_title where SellingPrice=4.95;

   nested:
   1)select * from ab_title where SellingPrice=(select MIN(SellingPrice) from ab_title);

   inner query must return column that outer query tests on
   select * from ab_title where *SellingPrice* = (select MIN(*SellingPrice*) from ab_title);

** Find all orders that contain book w/ isbn=0688010377 (show orderid and orderdate)
   
   solution:
   
   SELECT OrderId, OrderDate FROM ab_orders WHERE OrderId IN
   (SELECT OrderId FROM ab_orderdetail WHERE Isbn=0688010377)
** Find Isbn, Title of most expensive books
   SELECT Isbn, Title FROM ab_title where SellingPrice IN ;; or use = b/c it's an aggregate function
   (SELECT MAX(SellingPrice) from ab_title)
   
** Isbn, Title of books that sell above average price
   select Isbn, Title from ab_title where SellingPrice >=
   (select avg(SellingPrice) from ab_title)

** Isbn, Title QtyOnHand of books that have the most qty
   select Title from ab_title where QtyOnHand=
   (select max(QtyOnHand) from ab_title)

** find publishers (pubID & name) that publish either "programming" or "mystery" books
   SELECT PubId, Name FROM ab_publisher WHERE PubId IN 
   (SELECT Type FROM ab_title WHERE Type IN ("Programming","Mystery"))
   
** find all authors (authorId, first, last) that have written books
   SELECT AuthorId, FirstName, Lastname FROM ab_author WHERE AuthorId IN
   (SELECT DISTINCT(AuthorId) FROM ab_wrote)
