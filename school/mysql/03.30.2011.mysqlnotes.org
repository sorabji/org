** create table statement 
   google for syntax/options

   create table [tablename](
   [column name] [dataype] [constraint],
   ...,
   [primary key] (column name)
   [foreign key] (column name) [references] [another table name] (column name)
   [index] (index name) (column name,column name2, column name3)
   );
*** constraints 
    not null
    autoincrement 
    default [value]
** alter table statement 
   google for syntax/options
*** possible alterations
**** drop 
     [column] [column name]
     [index|key] [index name]
     [primary key]
     [foreign key] [fk_symbol]
     [table] [table name]
**** rename
     
**** add 
     [column] [column name] [column definition]
     [primary key] 
**** modify
**** change
    
** delete statement
   delete from [table name] where [column name="value"] limit [number]
** update statement 
   update [table name] set [column name = "value" ] where [column name = "value"] limit [number]
** primary key
   primary key (column name)
   index [index name] (column name)
** foreign key
   default engine does not suport foreign key

   [foreign key] (column name) [references] [another table name] (column name)

   when dealing w/ a 1:M relationship, the PK of the 1 table becomes FK of the M table
** referential integrity
   governs value of FK

   CAN be null
   if not null, must match PK of the 1 table
** entity integrity
   governs value of PK
   
   PK CANNOT BE NULL
   must be unique




* engine type/table type
**  oldest type of table/engine is MyISAM
    does not enforce referential integrity
    very fast/simple
** InnoDB
   default after mysql version 4.1.5 (not really)
   enforces transaction safe tables
   enforce referential integrity
   more sophisticated 
** Memory
   very fast, but volatile. 
   exists only in memory, NOT on disk
   goes away when mysql is stopped
   restart mysql, must relaod memory table



** sql commands
   show engines; 
   show engines\g; more verbose version

   show table status
   
   show columns from [table name]

   insert into [table name] values ([value 1,value 2,value 3...]);
    
   alter table [table name] [engine=engine]; to change the engine for a table...InnoDB
** terms
*** DDL
    Data Definition Language
*** DML
    Data Manipulation Language


* project 1...email soft copy to ckoon@coleman.edu

** part 1
   use chen's model to draw out 4 entities that correspond to the four bullets
   identify identifier, multi-value attributes 
   relationships, weak/strong, entities, etc.
** part 2
   map entities in part 1 to tables 
   draw tables in crow's foot model
** part 3
   Tabulate tables in part 2 to 0NF
   1NF (no repeating groups, PK identified)
   2NF (1NF, no partial dependency)
   3NF (2NF, no transitiv dependecy)
** part 4
   draw 3NF using crow's foot
